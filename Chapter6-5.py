Answer to Question 6.5

We fill the 3 quart jug all the way, then pour it into the 5 quart jug.
Then we fill the 3 quart jug again all the way, and pour it to the 5 quart
jug until the 5 quart jug gets full. We will have poured 2 quarts, and we will
have had 1 quart remaining in the 3 quart jug.
Then we dump the water from the 5 quart jug and fill it with the 1 quart that we
have in the 3 quart jug.
We then fill the 3 quart jug all the way and pour it into the 5 quart jug,
which gives us 1 + 3 = 4 quarts of water.
